## Platform Compatibility Note

MARM works across all major LLM platforms, including ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Grok.

It does not depend on native memory features. Instead, it uses manual logging, structured prompts, and reseeding to maintain context. This ensures consistency regardless of platform behavior or update cycles.

As memory capabilities evolve, MARM remains stable by desig, users always retain control.

## Short introduction:  
MARM is a protocol for beginner to advanced AI session memory, workflow management, and accuracy guardrails.  
This handbook includes all core commands, beginner guidance, and error handling tools.

---

## Core Activation

*Note: MARM prioritizes manual control and transparency. Some steps are intentionally not automated to ensure accuracy and prevent drift.*

**/start marm**  
Activates MARM’s session memory kernel and accuracy guardrails.  
*Use this as the first command in any MARM-enabled session.*

> **Beginner Tip:**  
> Just type `/start marm` at the beginning of your conversation. It prepares the AI to track memory and be more accurate.

---

## Session Management

MARM automatically differentiates between a simple session label and a structured log based on whether the input starts with a `[` character.

**/log [SessionName]**  
Creates a session “folder” label to organize conversation history.  
*Example:*  
`/log SessionA`

> **Beginner Tip:**  
> Use this to name your conversation. For example, `/log Ideas` helps the AI remember what you're working on.

**/log [YYYY-MM-DD | User | Intent | Outcome]**  
Adds a structured log entry for detailed session tracking.  
*Example:*  
`/log [2025-06-13 | Ryan | Introduced patch | Got feedback]`

> **Beginner Tip:**  
> You can skip this if you're just starting out. Use it later when you want to track outcomes from each session.

> **Tip:**  
> The `/log` command is smart, use it to either start a new session folder (`/log SessionA`) or add a detailed entry (`/log [date | user | intent | outcome]`).  
> MARM will auto-detect and organize your input.

---

## Compiling & Summarizing

**/compile [SessionName] --summary**  
Generates a concise, token-safe summary of all logs in a session. Outputs one line per entry.

**Optional flags:**  
`--fields=Intent,Outcome` to limit output to specific fields.  
*Example:*  
`/compile ProjectX --summary --fields=Intent,Outcome`

> **Beginner Tip:**  
> If you've logged a few things, use this to create a short recap. It makes it easier to pick up where you left off.

**System Output: Auto-Reseed Prompt**  
After compiling, MARM generates a formatted context block you can paste into a new session to resume progress.  
*No manual command needed.*

> **Beginner Tip:**  
> After compiling, just copy and paste the summary block into your next chat. It will reconnect the AI with what you were doing.

---

## Accuracy Tools

**/guarded reply** (formerly `/contextual reply`)  
Replaces standard response behavior with a logic-guarded output. Adds reasoning and context validation.

> **Beginner Tip:**  
> Use this when the AI starts to feel off-topic or makes assumptions. It forces better logic.

**/show reasoning**  
Displays the logic chain or decision path used in the last response.  
*Useful for audits or debugging.*

> **Beginner Tip:**  
> Curious why the AI said something? Use this to see its reasoning and double-check accuracy.

---

## Error Handling and Schema Rules

**Log Format Enforcement**  
All structured logs must follow this format:  
`[YYYY-MM-DD | User | Intent | Outcome]`  
Invalid formats trigger correction prompts or autofill suggestions (e.g., current date if missing).

> **Beginner Tip:**  
> If you get a format warning, don't worry. MARM will usually guide you to fix it or fill in missing parts.

**Autofill and Correction Support**  
MARM detects incomplete or malformed log entries and will either prompt correction or apply default values to maintain clean summaries.

> **Beginner Tip:**  
> You don’t need to be perfect with formatting. MARM helps clean it up for you.

---

## Versioning Note

 **Compatibility:**

> MARM is developed iteratively. v1.2 and beyond reflect the current protocol structure.  
> If you're using an earlier version, it's recommended you update. (backward compatibility isn't guaranteed)
