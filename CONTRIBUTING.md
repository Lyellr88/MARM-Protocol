# Contributing to MARM

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Memory Accurate Response Mode (MARM) Protocol. Whether you're here to test, give feedback, suggest improvements, or help evolve the framework, you're part of making something more stable and transparent in LLM interactions.

---

## How to Contribute

### Test the Protocol
Run MARM through your own workflows using `/log`, `/compile`, and reseed blocks.  
Report any drift, breakdowns, or UX issues. Especially across different LLMs like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or Perplexity.

### Suggest Enhancements
If you’ve identified friction points, architectural gaps, or ways to simplify the prompt layer, open a GitHub issue (or DM directly if we're already connected).

### Improve Documentation
You can submit typo fixes, restructure guides, or help clarify edge-case behaviors.

### Developer Support (Optional)
If you have Python, JSON, or LLM toolchain experience and want to help convert MARM into a working tool or plugin, reach out. I'm looking to move from protocol to product in future phases.

## Current Contributors

The following users directly shaped the protocol through feedback, ideas, or early support:

### Reddit: [u/ophydian210](https://www.reddit.com/user/ophydian210)  
Provided early-stage critique and refinement feedback on memory simulation, session labeling, and user experience logic. Influenced the removal of the confidence scoring system, the creation of the `/show reasoning` command, and improvements to session lifecycle documentation.

### Reddit: [u/CalamityThorazine](https://www.reddit.com/user/CalamityThorazine) & [u/Crazy_Crayfish_](https://www.reddit.com/user/Crazy_Crayfish_)  
Encouraged the move from temporary hosting (e.g., Google Drive) to GitHub, improving accessibility and trust. Their early interest helped validate public release and shaped the decision to publish the protocol in a permanent, versioned repository.

### Reddit: [u/MykoJai168](https://www.reddit.com/user/MykoJai168)  
Sparked the architectural concept behind MARM’s “Session Relay Tools” patch by proposing a layered, context-managed memory model. Offered collaboration, stress-testing interest, and early insight into multi-agent recall, which helped validate MARM’s patch direction. Credited for contributing to the prompt-layer vision and user-side continuity design.
