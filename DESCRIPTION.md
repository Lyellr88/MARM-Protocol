The **MARM Protocol** is the result of synthesizing insights from a wide range of discussions and feedback found across online communities, with a particular focus on Reddit threads where users shared their real-world experiences and frustrations with large language models. This community-driven approach ensures that **MARM** directly addresses the most pressing needs and challenges faced by today’s LLM users, from maintaining conversational continuity to reducing errors and hallucinations.

As LLMs become increasingly central to how we interact with technology, the demand for protocols that enhance reliability through structured prompting is growing rapidly. **MARM** stands out as a forward-thinking solution, designed to remain adaptable as AI platforms evolve. It enables users to structure their interaction with the AI supporting more accurate, transparent, and context-aware conversations.

Its ultimate goal is to make LLMs more practical and dependable for everyone.

## Audio Walkthrough

Want a guided breakdown of how MARM works and why it was built?

**Listen to the 5-minute AI-narrated** [Download MARM Walkthrough (MP3, 3.3 MB)](media/media_MARM_Audio_Walkthrough.mp3)     
This podcast-style breakdown was generated using NotebookLM, based on my original protocol documentation and design notes. The voice is AI-synthesized but the system, structure, and vision are fully mine.

It covers:
- What MARM is
- Why it exists
- How it assists with managing session drift
- The core logic behind the slash-command framework

> Designed for anyone curious about LLM  session structuring, prompt architecture, or transparent protocol workflows.
