## v1.2 – 2025-06-19

---

### Added
- **Session Continuity Tools:**  
  Core support for multi-session workflows, including:
  - `/compile` command to generate one-line-per-entry summaries  
  - Automatic reseed block generation for restoring context in new threads  
  - Log schema enforcement for structured logging: `[YYYY-MM-DD | User | Intent | Outcome]`  
  - Error handling for malformed log entries, including date autofill

- **Manual Steps Justification Section:**  
  Added “Why Manual Steps Matter” to the top of `HANDBOOK.md` to reinforce protocol philosophy and outline command roles.

- **Consolidated Examples Section:**  
  Added a standalone collapsible “Examples (Complete Usage)” block to `HANDBOOK.md` showing real use cases for all major commands.

- **Clarified Optional System Prompt Behavior:**  
  Added a section in `HANDBOOK.md` noting that proactive context prompts are not built into MARM but supported as optional platform-level extensions.

- **New Session Management Guidance:**  
  Introduced best practices for avoiding drift in long sessions—e.g., recap every 8–10 turns using `/compile`.

- **/show reasoning command:**  
  Reveals the AI’s logic or decision path for its most recent response.

- **HANDBOOK.md:**  
  Full command reference and usage guide including beginner tips, advanced workflows, examples, and platform compatibility behavior.

- **Collapsible Section Formatting:**  
  Converted all major `HANDBOOK.md` sections (Part I, II, III, Examples, Quick Reference) into `<details>` for improved navigation and reduced scroll.

- **Comprehensive FAQ.md:**  
  Topic-grouped questions covering naming, resuming, reseeding, command logic, platform compatibility, and manual usage philosophy.

- **Expanded Limitations section:**  
  Clarifies session boundaries, memory constraints, and intended use cases.

- **Slash-style command syntax standardization:**  
  All user-facing commands now follow consistent formatting:
  - `/start marm`  
  - `/log [SessionName]`  
  - `/guarded reply`  
  - `/show reasoning`  
  - `/compile [SessionName] --summary`

- **AI-narrated walkthrough:**  
  Embedded 15-minute audio guide explaining MARM’s core features and logic.

- **User Feedback section:**  
  Collapsible section in README.md with real-world highlights and screenshots.

- **Featured on Google badge:**  
  Added to README.md header to highlight visibility and adoption.

- **CONTRIBUTING.md and Recognition Framework:**  
  Added structure for listing contributors, testers, and discussion participants.

- **Multi-tier discussion structure:**  
  Created layered discussion entry points via GitHub Discussions and Contributing paths.

### Changed
- **Unified session tools as default protocol behavior**  
  Session tools such as `/compile`, reseed blocks, and log enforcement are now core—not optional.

- **README.md structure updates:**  
  - Moved Quick Start above Initiation Prompt  
  - Removed “Core Features” section to avoid duplication with HANDBOOK.md  
  - Clarified expected AI response in the Acknowledgment block

- **HANDBOOK.md structure updates:**  
  - Restructured content into Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced collapsible sections  
  - Added “What’s New in v1.2” and clarified platform memory dependency  
  - Highlighted session recap cadence and manual command benefits  
  - Emphasized deliberate user structure for consistent performance

- **FAQ.md overhaul:**  
  - Grouped questions by category (Core Concepts, Sessions, Commands, Platform Support)  
  - Added new entries on logging frequency and manual command design  
  - Converted all sections into collapsible containers for easier reading

- **Protocol one-liner updated:**  
  Reflects v1.2 as a fully unified, standalone framework for structured memory and accuracy

---

### Removed
- **Legacy modular/optional language:**  
  Removed all mentions of patches, modular tools, and separate add-on sections

- **Embedded command list and in-file How-To from README.md:**  
  Moved to HANDBOOK.md for maintainability and clarity

- **Internal anchor links and "Back to top" navigation:**  
  Removed due to GitHub’s behavior with collapsible content

- **Confidence flag/scoring feature:**  
  Removed from protocol outputs to reduce clutter and simplify expected AI response

- **All references to auto-save or passive memory:**  
  Removed speculative claims about automatic memory behavior to reinforce MARM’s manual foundation
