## 📌 Overview

MARM is a protocol for AI reliability. It gives you control over memory and logic by letting you log sessions, store your own notes, and compile summaries. The result: fewer hallucinations, transparent reasoning, and conversations that stay on track.  
**Steer the AI instead of chasing it.**

## 🧪 Built For Research + Real Use

MARM is both a power-user tool and a research scaffold:

**AI Safety & Reasoning Research**
- Study systematic reasoning in language models  
- Analyze memory persistence across sessions  
- Measure hallucination reduction with structured prompts  

**Business Intelligence**
- Maintain context across long analytical threads  
- Build organizational knowledge into sessions  
- Reinforce consistent decision-making frameworks  

**Educational & Training Use**
- Teach critical thinking via structured interaction  
- Build personalized learning repositories  
- Guide model reasoning with user-curated facts  

**Not built for:**  
Small talk • Throwaway chats • Passive use

## ❓ Why MARM?

Modern LLMs often lose context or fabricate information. MARM introduces a session memory kernel, structured logs, and a user-controlled knowledge library. Anchoring the AI to *your* logic and data. It’s more than a chatbot wrapper. It’s a methodology for accountable AI.

### Read Before You Start

* Start MARM in a **new session** for best results  
* MARM **does not persist** across threads  
* To resume long sessions, use `/compile` and reseed manually  
* Commands are **manual by design** to ensure transparency and user control  

---

## 🔑 Key Features & Command Overview

### Key Features:

- **Session memory kernel** – Tracks user intent and prompts clarification  
- **Structured logs** – Use `/log` and `/compile` to build summaries  
- **Personal library** – Use `/notebook` to guide model outputs with your notes  
- **Accuracy guardrails** – Optional logic checks to reduce false outputs   

### Command Overview:

Session Commands
- `/start marm` → Activate protocol  
- `/refresh marm` → Reaffirm/reset context  

Core Commands
- `/log` → Start structured session logging  
- `/notebook` → Store key data  
- `/compile` → Summarize and reseed sessions  

Advanced Tools
- `/contextual reply` → Request context-aware response  
- `/show reasoning` → Reveal logic trail of last answer  

#### Quick Start (for copy and paste protocol)

```
/start marm  
/log entry [Date - Summary - Result]  
/compile SessionName --summary
```
