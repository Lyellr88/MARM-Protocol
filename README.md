### Overview

MARM is a protocol for AI reliability. It gives you control over memory and logic by letting you log sessions, store your own notes, and compile summaries. The result: fewer hallucinations, transparent reasoning, and conversations that stay on track.  
**Steer the AI instead of chasing it.**

> For copy-and-paste prompt users and full technical details, see [`PROTOCOL.md`](./PROTOCOL.md)

---

### ðŸ›‘ Read Before You Start

* Start MARM in a **new session** for best results  
* MARM **does not persist** across threads  
* To resume long sessions, use `/compile` and reseed manually  
* Commands are **manual by design** to ensure transparency and user control  

---

### Built For Research + Real Use

MARM is both a power-user tool and a research scaffold:

#### AI Safety & Reasoning Research
- Study systematic reasoning in language models  
- Analyze memory persistence across sessions  
- Measure hallucination reduction with structured prompts  

#### Business Intelligence
- Maintain context across long analytical threads  
- Build organizational knowledge into sessions  
- Reinforce consistent decision-making frameworks  

#### Educational & Training Use
- Teach critical thinking via structured interaction  
- Build personalized learning repositories  
- Guide model reasoning with user-curated facts  

**Also built for:**
- Prompt engineers stress-testing LLMs  
- Multi-session AI power users  
- Writers/system builders tired of re-explaining logic  

**Not built for:**  
Small talk â€¢ Throwaway chats â€¢ Passive use

### Why MARM?

Modern LLMs often lose context or fabricate information. MARM introduces a session memory kernel, structured logs, and a user-controlled knowledge library. Anchoring the AI to *your* logic and data.  
Itâ€™s more than a chatbot wrapper. itâ€™s a methodology for accountable AI.

### Key Features & Command Overview

#### Core Protocol
- **Session memory kernel** â€“ Tracks user intent and prompts clarification  
- **Structured logs** â€“ Use `/log` and `/compile` to build summaries  
- **Personal library** â€“ Use `/notebook` to guide model outputs with your notes  
- **Accuracy guardrails** â€“ Optional logic checks to reduce false outputs  

#### Session Commands
- `/start marm` â†’ Activate protocol  
- `/refresh marm` â†’ Reaffirm/reset context  

#### Core Commands
- `/log` â†’ Start structured session logging  
- `/notebook` â†’ Store key data  
- `/compile` â†’ Summarize and reseed sessions  

#### Advanced Tools
- `/contextual reply` â†’ Request context-aware response  
- `/show reasoning` â†’ Reveal logic trail of last answer  

#### Quick Start

```text
/start marm  
/log entry [Date - Summary - Result]  
/compile SessionName --summary
```
