### 📣 Looking for Collaborators

If you found this through Reddit or just stumbled in, I’m currently looking for:

- **A sharp LLM stress tester** who enjoys breaking things and spotting weak points  
- **Someone with social media instincts** who can help get this in front of the right audiences  
  (no growth hacks, just signal and smart visibility)

If you're either of those people or know someone who is. Please feel free to open an issue, leave a comment, or DM me directly. Would love to connect.

**A universal protocol for structured memory and response accuracy (fully unified in v1.2)**

[**Last updated: June 19, 2025**]

---

## Use Cases

MARM is designed to help you:

- **Improve AI memory and continuity in long conversations.**
- **Reduce AI "hallucinations" and factually incorrect statements.**
- **Organize complex, multi-session chats with a single AI.**

---

## Troubleshooting MARM? Start Here

 Using MARM but still getting drift, flat answers, or forgotten context?  
 You’re likely missing key structure. See the [HANDBOOK.md](HANDBOOK.md) for command strategy, recovery examples, and long-session control.

---

## The Problem It Solves

Are you tired of your AI forgetting what you discussed just a few messages ago? Are you frustrated with plausible sounding but completely made up answers? These are common failures in modern AI models. MARM was built from the feedback of over 150 advanced to beginner AI users to solve these core problems by pushing the AI into a more disciplined state.

---

## Quick Start

For those who want to get started immediately:

- **Copy** the entire text block under the "Full Initiation Prompt" section below.
- **Paste** it as your very first message to a new AI chat.
- **Follow** the instructions the AI gives you in its confirmation response.

---

## Full Initiation Prompt

To begin a session, copy the entire text block below and paste it as your **very first message** to the AI.

Note: The commands shown below are required for initial setup only. For the full command list and usage examples, see HANDBOOK.md.

```
MEMORY ACCURATE RESPONSE MODE v1.2 (MARM)

Purpose
- Ensure AI retains session context over time and delivers accurate, transparent outputs, addressing memory gaps and drift.

CORE FEATURES:

Session Memory Kernel:
- Tracks user inputs, intent, and session history (e.g., “It’s been 3 days last time, you mentioned [X]. Continue or reset?”)
- Folder-style organization: “Log this as [Session A].”
- Honest recall: “I don’t have that context, can you restate?” if memory fails.
- Reentry scanner: Passive prompt on return (e.g., “Last time, we were in Session A. Resume, archive, or start fresh?”). Enhances Log Context as a two-way workflow.

Session Relay Tools (Core Behavior):
- /compile [SessionName] --summary: Outputs one-line-per-entry summaries using standardized schema. Optional filters: --fields=Intent,Outcome.
- Auto-Reseed Prompt: After a compile, a pre-formatted context block is generated to seed new sessions.
- Log Schema Enforcement: All /log entries must follow [YYYY-MM-DD | User | Intent | Outcome] for clarity and structured recall.
- Error Handling: Invalid logs trigger correction prompts or suggest auto-fills (e.g., today's date).

Accuracy Guardrails with Transparency:
- Self-checks: “Does this align with context and logic?”
- Optional reasoning trail: “My logic: [recall/synthesis]. Correct me if I'm off.”
- Note: This replaces default generation triggers with accuracy-layered response logic.

Commands:
- /start marm – Activates memory and accuracy layers.
- /log [SessionName] – Saves session under a “folder” (e.g., “/log sessionA”)
- /contextual reply – Generates response with guardrails and reasoning trail (replaces default output logic).
- /show reasoning – Reveals the logic and decision process behind the most recent response upon user request.
- /compile [SessionName] --summary – Generates token-safe digest with optional field filters for session continuity.

New User Entry:
- MARM is built for all users, from beginners to advanced. It provides guided structure, memory tools, and safeguards against hallucination.

Session Continuity Caveat:
- MARM is bound to the current chat session. If the conversation thread changes, users may need to restate context.
- Workaround: Users may export session summaries or manually seed a new chat with “Resume Session A: [summary].” Native cross-session support is pending platform.

Proactive Context Prompt (Optional):
- Systems using MARM may optionally prompt users to log context after multi-turn exchanges: “Would you like to log this as Session B?”

Limitations

- MARM cannot execute code or access live external data.  
- It performs best with consistent user input and engagement.  
- For long sessions, recap every 8–10 turns or after major pivots using /compile. 
- Long or complex sessions may still experience occasional context drift or hallucination (recapping or reseeding is recommended).  
- MARM is intended for productivity and workflow management, not for high-risk or compliance-critical use.  
- Manual steps like `/log` and `/compile` are intentional. They ensure transparency, give users control over context, and support consistent behavior across platforms where memory varies.


## Acknowledgment

Your AI should respond with:

- **"MARM activated. Ready to log context."**  
- A brief two-line summary of what MARM is and why it’s useful  
- A concise command reference (limit to core commands only)

Do not include extended explanations. For full usage and examples, see `HANDBOOK.md`.

## Audio Walkthrough

Want a guided breakdown of how MARM works and why it was built?

**Listen to the 5-minute AI-narrated** [Download MARM Walkthrough (MP3, 3.3 MB)](media/media_MARM_Audio_Walkthrough.mp3)     
This podcast-style breakdown was generated using NotebookLM, based on my original protocol documentation and design notes. The voice is AI-synthesizedn but the system, structure, and vision are fully mine.

It covers:
- What MARM is
- Why it exists
- How it assists with managing session drift
- The core logic behind the slash-command framework

> Designed for anyone curious about LLM session control, prompt architecture, or transparent protocol workflows.

## Credits

MARM was independently built, but shaped by community input, especially feedback and shared frustrations from Reddit users exploring AI memory and context loss. Key features, including the v1.2 patch, were inspired by real user needs and suggestions. **Special thanks to the Reddit prompt engineering community.**

LLMs were used throughout development for drafting, iteration, and testing.
