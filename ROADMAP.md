## Core Focus (Now – v1.2.x)
- Refine documentation based on user feedback
- Add more real-world usage examples and templates
- Improve navigation for first-time users (e.g., FAQ polish, Handbook anchors)
- Monitor adoption patterns for API-tier users vs casual interfaces

## Planned (v1.3 – Long-Term Additions)
- Add `cheatsheet.md` for minimal startup users
- Explore cross-thread reseed format for long-term continuity
- Test modular overlays (MARM + journaling or agents)
- Evaluate markdown export or log file generation options

## Community + Feedback
- Open call for integration feedback from dev teams
- Add "Used With MARM" showcase for variations/adaptations
- Contributor recognition improvements

## Related Projects (In Development)
The following is a separate, standalone protocol also in development by the MARM author. It is designed to work alongside or independently of MARM to solve a different, but related, challenge in LLM communication.****

### Repetition Echo Protocol (REP) v2  
*Practical loop-guard for multi-LLM and AI chat systems*

**Purpose:**  
Reduce redundant AI repetition (“echoes”) in conversation while preserving user intent, clarity, and override control. REP is designed to minimize noise, not access—offering guided summaries and optional repeat triggers rather than hard suppression.
