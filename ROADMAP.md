# MARM Roadmap 
*Updated - July 16th, 2025*

## Core Focus (Current)
- The MARM Protocol has been updated to **v1.4** and is now considered feature-complete and polished for the time being.
- The primary focus has shifted from protocol design to hands-on development and learning.
- The official MARM-powered **chatbot is in the final stages of development** and will be launching soon as a live, interactive demo.

## New Vision & Planned Enhancements
- Integrate MARM with workflow tools like **n8n** to automate some of the manual commands for power-users.
- Implement a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system to provide the chatbot with deeper, more intelligent long-term memory based on user logs and notebooks.
- Explore the dual-path future for MARM: continue to offer the standalone chatbot while also developing MARM into an **add-on tool or API** for other developers to integrate into their own applications.

## Community + Feedback
- Open call for integration feedback from dev teams.
- Add "Used With MARM" showcase for variations/adaptations.
- Contributor recognition improvements.
